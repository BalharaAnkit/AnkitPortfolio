                <h2>Junior Developer</h2>
                <p>Zing Dev Limited</p>
                July 2024- September 2025
                <div class="hoteldis">My time at Zing has been an incredible journey of learning, growth, and contribution. From comprehensive training in Agile
methodologies, Twilio, and core development tools like TypeScript and React, to working on impactful real world projects for clients
such as AgeUK, IBEW, NRC, BMW, Red Cross, Jaja Finance, Humanity Link, and NLRC, I have gained valuable hands-on experience
in both front-end and back-end development. I’ve also contributed to internal initiatives like the Zing Check-In Bot, Zing Docs, and the
Planning Poker Rebranding. Additionally, I have provided frontline customer support, deepening my problem-solving and
communication skills. I’ve even had the opportunity to contribute to the company's future by assisting with interviews for prospective
placement students. Zing has offered me a well-rounded, industry-level experience that has helped me grow technically,
professionally, and personally. My main work at Zing is as follows:
• Created and maintained documentation for internal and client-facing software, ensuring long-term maintainability and knowledge
sharing.
• Adopted various programming languages and tools (TypeScript, React, Node.js, Twilio Studio, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to
meet project-specific requirements efficiently.
• Ensured high software quality through rigorous unit testing, end-to-end testing, and automated test suites, contributing to stable
releases.
• Collaborated within cross-functional Agile teams, participating in daily standups, sprint planning, and code reviews to uphold best
practices and team productivity.
• Identified, debugged, and resolved software defects in both production and staging environments, maintaining system reliability
and user satisfaction.
• Integrated third-party APIs (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, Monday.com, GraphQL) for robust system functionality in CRM and
communications platforms.
• Worked directly with clients and stakeholders to gather requirements, demonstrate progress, and iterate on deliverables based on
real-time feedback.
• Played an active role in intern recruitment, conducting technical assessments and interviews, and sharing insights from a placement
student’s perspective. </div>
